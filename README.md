# Framework keyboards

A simple on screen keyboard made in a few different frameworks, just for fun.

## Installation

Requires npm and bower, to install dependencies, navigate to the subdirectory of the keyboard you want to run, then run:

```
npm install
bower install
```

Then, to compile and run some useful watchers, just run:

```
grunt
```
